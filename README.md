# HROne Frontend Intern Hiring Task

## Task Overview
Create a sample backend application for a JSON Schema Builder using ReactJS and preferably Ant Design or ShadCN, optionally incorporating TypeScript if possible. This task assumes a basic understanding of JavaScript, along with some knowledge of ReactJS and AntD/ShadCN. The objective is to develop a Schema Building experience, as demonstrated in the provided video, utilising React-Hook Forms for the implementation.

## Task Description
Build a component that allows users to create an interface to define a JSON schema by adding fields dynamically. Users should be able to edit the name/key of a field, add more fields, delete a field, and add nested fields for the 'Nested' type. The supported types are String, Number, and Nested, with the ability to have recursive nested rows.

### Key Tasks
Develop a component with the following functionalities:
- Edit the name/key of a field
- Add more fields dynamically
- Delete a field
- Add nested fields for the 'Nested' type (recursively)
- Include a JSON tab that displays the real-time JSON preview of the components. Assume default values for String and Number type rows, as demonstrated in the provided video.




As you progress through these steps, you'll build the foundation for the more complex aspects of the component.

- ReactJS with TypeScript
- Vite as the build tool
